<h1>Y DO THEY COME UP</h1>
<h2>by Malakai Greiner</h2>
When I say I have some teeth I mean I have some teeth. I think I only have 28 (no wisdom), but I have yet to count them all. I’ve picked up a lot of habits from my teeth -- they came up late and stayed too late (wobbling but hanging on until they absolutely had to let go). If the trend continues, I might just die with a full mouth. But remember how you didn’t have any once? They popped up through yr gums so violently they gave the process a name: Teething. (That’s when you teeth). I know I can’t remember when my teeth cut my gums for the first time, but I bet you can! I’ve been trying to remember by cutting my teeth on everything I can, turning enamel into knives like it’s a hobby. I’m not quite sure what comes after this, but I would be disappointed if it ever stopped (cos then I wouldn’t have an excuse to chew on the stuff and cry all the time). Here is an exercise for you to try at home: rub your bare gums on something firm yet malleable to tease your teeth from below the surface. If you’re having trouble getting them to show, try giving them a reason. Here are some coaxing words for your boney bridgework:
Once you come up you can touch the sun. Once you come up you can help me chew. Once you come up, no matter how you do it, you can look good to me. Once you come up, no matter how you do it, you can make me look good. Once you come up you can work. Once you come up you can grow (this one is definitely a lie but your teeth do not need to know that). Once you come up you can be braced by metal vices, but I will choose my own color of rubber bands so we can match. Once you come up we can be twins! Once you come up you can yellow. Once you come up we can smile at good friends. Once you come up, we can grimace at soggy-bottom-of-the-sink-muck. Once you come up you can clack together to create sound. Once you come up we can produce some alveolar voice-
less fricatives together with the tounge and the larynx. Once you come up, you can rot. Once you come up you’ll be up! If they ask “what then,” don’t tell them that they’ll fall back out and you’ll grow a new set. Let them think they’ll bite down forever.
